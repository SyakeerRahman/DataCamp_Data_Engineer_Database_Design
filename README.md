# DataCamp_Data_Engineer_Database_Design

Course Description
A good database design is crucial for a high-performance application. Just like you wouldn't start building a house without the benefit of a blueprint, you need to think about how your data will be stored beforehand. Taking the time to design a database saves time and frustration later on, and a well-designed database ensures ease of access and retrieval of information. While choosing a design, a lot of considerations have to be accounted for. In this course, you'll learn how to process, store, and organize data in an efficient way. You'll see how to structure data through normalization and present your data with views. Finally, you'll learn how to manage your database and all of this will be done on a variety of datasets from book sales, car rentals, to music reviews.

### 1. Processing, Storing, and Organizing Data

Start your journey into database design by learning about the two approaches to data processing, OLTP and OLAP. In this first chapter, you'll also get familiar with the different forms data can be stored in and learn the basics of data modeling.

- [ ] OLTP and OLAP
- [ ] OLAP vs. OLTP
- [ ] Which is better?
- [ ] Storing data
- [ ] Name that data type!
- [ ] Ordering ETL Tasks
- [ ] Recommend a storage solution
- [ ] Database design
- [ ] Classifying data models
- [ ] Deciding fact and dimension tables
- [ ] Querying the dimensional model

### 2. Database Schemas and Normalization

In this chapter, you will take your data modeling skills to the next level. You'll learn to implement star and snowflake schemas, recognize the importance of normalization and see how to normalize databases to different extents.

- [ ] Star and snowflake schema
- [ ] Running from star to snowflake
- [ ] Adding foreign keys
- [ ] Extending the book dimension
- [ ] Normalized and denormalized databases
- [ ] Querying the star schema
- [ ] Querying the snowflake schema
- [ ] Updating countries
- [ ] Extending the snowflake schema
- [ ] Normal forms
- [ ] Converting to 1NF
- [ ] Converting to 2NF
- [ ] Converting to 3NF

### 3. Database Views

Get ready to work with views! In this chapter, you will learn how to create and query views. On top of that, you'll master more advanced capabilities to manage them and end by identifying the difference between materialized and non-materialized views.

- [ ] Database views
- [ ] Tables vs. views
- [ ] Viewing views
- [ ] Creating and querying a view
- [ ] Managing views
- [ ] Creating a view from other views
- [ ] Granting and revoking access
- [ ] Updatable views
- [ ] Redefining a view
- [ ] Materialized views
- [ ] Materialized versus non-materialized
- [ ] Creating and refreshing a materialized view
- [ ] Managing materialized views

### 4. Database Management

This final chapter ends with some database management-related topics. You will learn how to grant database access based on user roles, how to partition tables into smaller pieces, what to keep in mind when integrating data, and which DBMS fits your business needs best.

- [ ] Database roles and access control
- [ ] Create a role
- [ ] GRANT privileges and ALTER attributes
- [ ] Add a user role to a group role
- [ ] Table partitioning
- [ ] Reasons to partition
- [ ] Partitioning and normalization
- [ ] Creating vertical partitions
- [ ] Creating horizontal partitions
- [ ] Data integration
- [ ] Data integration do's and dont's
- [ ] Analyzing a data integration plan
- [ ] Picking a Database Management System (DBMS)
- [ ] SQL versus NoSQL
- [ ] Choosing the right DBMS
